# simpleUDPwx
Simple, send-only, APRS-IS weather station based on ESP8266 and BME280 sensor.
*Simple* means simple to use, simple to understand and simple to learn on.
It is not recommended to use this software in battery powered projects because it is not using low-power mode of ESP8266.
This project is unstable and delivered "as is".

## Getting started

### Hardware requirements

### Installing

### Configuring
```
class Config:

    wifi_ssid = 'WiFi_name'  # WiFi SSID.
    wifi_passwd = 'WiFi_password'  # WiFi password.
    wifi_timeout = 60

    # List of APRS-IS servers. ( ['server1', 'server2'] )
    # Please make sure all of them supports UDP connection. You can use status.aprs2.net for that.
    servers = ['krakow.aprs2.net', 'euskadi.aprs2.net', 'romania.aprs2.net', 'belgium.aprs2.net']
    txDelay = 5  # Delay between frames (in minutes).

    call = 'N0CALL-1'  # Call with or without suffix.
    passwd = '12345'  # APRS-IS password.
    symbol = '/_'  # Two symbol coded APRS icon.
    latitude = '5000.00N'
    longitude = '01900.00E'
    comment = 'simpleUDP WX station'  # Comment attached to WX data.
    status = ''  # Status sent as separate APRS frame. If None or '' additional frame will not be sent.
```

Parameters needs to be changed:
* wifi_ssid
* wifi_passwd
* call
* passwd
* latitude
* longitude
